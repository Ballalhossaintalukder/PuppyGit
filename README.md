## About ssh
Idk how support ssh on Android, so PuppyGit only support https for now, if you know how support ssh, please make a pr or give me some hints for that


## Build
import project to Android Studio, then build, that's all. (android NDK is required)
<br><br>
### if you want to build libs by your self
require:<br>
- jdk 1.8 or later (oracle or openjdk or adoptjdk, should all worked as expect)
- <a href=https://github.com/android/ndk/wiki/Changelog-r26#r26b>android ndk r26b</a>, and target abi is 'android21'
<br>
Then you can build every lib from source code, the source code of the libs, see <a href=https://github.com/catpuppyapp/PuppyGit?tab=readme-ov-file#libs>Libs</a>

<br><br>
I'll create some scripts for build the c libs in future. if you want to build them now, only way is do it by your handsðŸ¤—


## Security
For reduce risk of password leak, Your passwords of git repos(e.g. github) are encrypted saved in PuppyGit's database on your device, the password of password encryptor is not in this open source repo for security reason, if you want build PuppyGit by yourself, you better update the password and version to yours and dont share it for more safe:
- update `EncryptorImpl.kt`, set your password encryptor, or simple use default encryptor
- set your encryptor version and password in `PassEncryptHelper.kt`, the password must enough to long and better don't make it be public

note: you should not change the passwords of old versions of password encryptors, if changed, when you upgrade app will can't decrypt the passwords encrypted by encryptor with old passwords, then all saved passwords on user device will be invalid, users must delete all credentials, then restart app, then re create credentials again.


## Help translate
1. Download <a href="https://github.com/catpuppyapp/PuppyGit/blob/main/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml">strings.xml</a>
2. Translate the file's values to your language, e.g.```<help>help translate</help>```to```<help>å¸®åŠ©ç¿»è¯‘</help>```
3. Create a issue attaching the file you was translated, the issue should tell which language you traslated to

Then I'll add your language into PuppyGit in furthur version

*NOTE: the string in strings.xml like "ph_a3f241dc_NUMBER" are place holders, the last NUMBER is order, e.g. a string resource ```<str1>name: ph_a3f241dc_1, age: ph_a3f241dc_2</str1>```, will replaced when running, it maybe will show as: ```"name: abc, age: 123"```, if you have mistake with the order number, e.g.```<str1>name: ph_a3f241dc_2, age: ph_a3f241dc_1</str1>```, it may cause app show wrong text like ```"name: 123, age: abc"```


## Comments in code
this project has many chinese comments, and some comments are out-of-date or nonsense, I have no plan clean them, but if you read the codes, and you wonder know some comments meaning, try translator or ask me is ok
