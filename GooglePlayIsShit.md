### The Full Story of PuppyGit and Google Play
In the end of 2023, I was plan to create 2 apps, PuppyGit Pro and PuppyGit, the Pro for paid, another for free, but google play just broken my plan, the pro app, google play staffs let me update the privacy policy in 1month, I done it with few days, then submit, but censoring was over 1month, then my app got banned, reason is no update the privacy policy(I updated, but the google censor too slow, so...), after few days, google staff tell me "Congratulation! your app privacy file now passed, but due to your app banned, so can't make your app passed the censoring", how stupid..., then I send appeal email to google, but google reject my unban request. and, my free version app got banned too, just because I used the Git icon, google play staffs tell me I have no right use it and I am mislead people think my app is create by git official, then banned my free app too, ok, well, then even I removed the Git logo from PuppyGit icon, and re-submit a new version, still no one response till now, after 2 apps banned, then my google developer account got banned by too much apps banned, so google think I am a bad developer(wtf), then I appeal, but google play keep it's decision, finally, I give up talk to google play, I make the app free and open source, but I accept <a href=https://github.com/catpuppyapp/PuppyGit/blob/main/donate.md>donations</a>.


本来想做付费软件，写了一年，然后谷歌商店政策变化，对个人开发者极不友好，经过一番折腾终于临近上架，最终由于谷歌商店审核团队效率低下，导致我的app明明早就进行了修改，却在最终期限过后我的app都被下架了，才审核通过，这种情况发生在我的两个app上面，然后由于多个app被下架，又导致我的开发者账号被封，申诉也无果，最后无奈放弃上架谷歌商店了，干脆就删掉了广告，去掉了增值业务，直接做成了免费软件，不过还是希望得到支持，因为实在是穷，现在工作又难找，你可以加星标并<a href=https://github.com/catpuppyapp/PuppyGit/blob/main/donate.md>捐赠</a>以给我提供支持，谢谢！
