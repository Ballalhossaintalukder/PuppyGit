### The Full Story of PuppyGit and Google Play
In the end of 2023, I was plan to create 2 apps, PuppyGit Pro and PuppyGit, the Pro for paid, another for free, but google play just broken my plan, the pro app, google play staffs let me update the privacy policy in 1month, I done it with few days, then submit, but censoring was over 1month, then my app got banned, reason is no update the privacy policy(I updated, but the google censor too slow, so...), after few days, google staff tell me "Congratulation! your app privacy file now passed, but due to your app banned, so can't make your app passed the censoring", how stupid..., then I send appeal email to google, but google reject my unban request. and, my free version app got banned too, just because I used the Git icon, google play staffs tell me I have no right use it and I am mislead people think my app is create by git official, then banned my free app too, ok, well, then even I removed the Git logo from PuppyGit icon, and re-submit a new version, still no one response till now, after 2 apps banned, then my google developer account got banned by too much apps banned, so google think I am a bad developer(wtf), then I appeal, but google play keep it's decision, finally, I give up talk to google play, I make the app free and open source, but I accept donations.
